Dodgy Bird

Instructions:

Preparation
Connect a USB mini cable to both funkits and upload the program through 'make' and 'make program' in the terminal(Ensure you are in the correct directory).
Alternatively if the program has been previously uploaded then you can press the button S3 for a few seconds followed by the S2 button aswell.
Ensure you and your playing partner are holding the funkit near to each other(at least 5 cm) and away from other funkits or direct light sources(to reduce interference).

In-game
Both players will be shown a character select screen which can be proceeded by pushing the navigational switch.
Each player will be given a choice to pick a character: The Bird or the Cannon.
There cannot be an instance where two same characters are chosen. If a player has chosen the Bird then the other player must be the Cannon and vice-versa.
Once a character is selected the player will be shown a text and image of their selected character followed by a 'syncing' text.

Syncing

Once both funkits have entered their syncing state either player can move the navigational switch up which will prompt the countdown user interface for both players and the game will begin.


Bird gameplay
The Bird can move freely both vertically and horizontally.
The goal of the Bird is to avoid getting hit by the projectiles of the Cannon.
The three dots displayed above the bird represents its lives.
Everytime the cannonball from the cannon hits the bird the screen of the Bird player will flash signifying it has been hit and the three dots(lives) will be decremented accordingly.
Once the Bird has used all its lives the Bird player will lose and the game will end and a game over screen will be shown.



Cannon gameplay 
The Cannon can only move vertically and is able to fire a cannonball by pushing the navigation switch.
The goal of the Cannon is to try to hit the Bird.
If the Bird remains alive after 30 seconds the Cannon player loses and the game will end and a game over screen will be shown.
